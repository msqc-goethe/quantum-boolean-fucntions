# QuantumBooleanFunctions
Code of a Bachelor's Thesis dealing with benchmarking quantum compilers on boolean functions

This repository implements boolean functions in Qiskit, Tket, pyQuil, Cirq and a small example in BQSKit.
The boolean functions are compiled using the gate set RX,RY,RZ,Phase and CX and different topologies.
We thought it is good to see some examples, because the documentation of some frameworks is not always straight forward.

I plan to extend the number of examples as soon as there is time for it.
